        <p>
            This student profile website was developed as part of the <strong>CPE106L – Software Design Laboratory</strong> 
            to explore and apply fundamental principles of software and web design. The website showcases my 
            academic background, technical and soft skills, certifications, and personal interests in an 
            organized and interactive format.
        </p>
        <p>
            Created using <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub</strong>, the website features a 
            <strong>Mapúa University–inspired colorway</strong>, a responsive layout, and 
            <strong>interactive click-to-view (accordion) sections</strong> to enhance user experience. 
            Additional features include <strong>dark mode functionality</strong>, smooth animations, and 
            a clean, modern interface emphasizing usability and clarity.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project allowed me to practice front-end development concepts such as structured content design, 
            event handling, styling, and user interface interaction. It also serves as a personal academic 
            portfolio reflecting my growth as a Computer Engineering student at Mapúa University.

    <h2 class="accordion">👤 About Me</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            I’m Richard Von P. Sopongco, a Computer Engineering student at Mapúa University and a consistent honor student. I’m someone who thrives on leadership, service, and personal growth, always looking for ways to make a positive impact.

        </p>
        <p>From elementary school, I embraced responsibility, taking on leadership roles in the Supreme Student Government and Junior Rescuer Team, while also enjoying the challenges of sports. In high school, I led the Barkada Kontra Droga – Sci Hi Chapter, inspiring my peers to live a drug-free, values-driven life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though I didn’t pursue a military academy path, the principles of service, discipline, and resilience remain central to who I am. I approach life with purpose, aiming to grow, lead, and make a difference wherever I go.
